**Show**  -This is get route to retrieve one individual task. 

**New** -A new task instance will be created. This is the get route.

**Create** -A task will be created on the server. This the post route. 

**Edit ** -This retrieves an instance from the Task model to be edited. This is the get route.

### Server Configuration: `RabbitMQ`

[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) is an open source Message Queuing server. It supports the Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP 0-8,0-9(-1)) and is implemented in Erlang. RabbitMQ uses Erlang for cluster management and for permanent storage of messages in the queue (in case of server failure).

It also, unfortunately, uses Erlang syntax for configuration.

#### The Question

Provide the contents of a simple configuration file which disables TCP keepalive.  Note: RabbitMQ default to TCP keepalive being on ;).

### Testing & Code Review

#### Testing

Place answers for Testing questions in the standard Rails location.  Comments detailing the tests are generally useful, but not required.

#### Code Review

Place answers for Code Review questions inline with the code being reviewed. Begin each code review comment with `### REVIEW: [your comment here]` to make finding them easier (only the first line of a multiline comment needs to be prefixed).  There isn't necessarily a right or wrong way to conduct a code review.  Be as strict as you are 'in the wild' so to speak.  The only required code review comments are for code that seems erroneous.
